
# In Python, static methods are methods within a class that are not bound to an instance of the class. They are defined using the @staticmethod decorator and do not receive the implicit first argument self (or cls for class methods) that instance methods do.

# class Math:
#     @staticmethod
#     def add(a,b):
#         return a*b
# result = Math.add(9,9)
# print(result)


# class MathOperation:
#     @staticmethod
#     def add(x,y):
#         return x+y
    
#     @staticmethod
#     def subtract(x,y):
#         return x-y

# print(MathOperation.add(12,4))
# print(MathOperation.subtract(12,4))
